# COVID-19 Data Analysis Project

This repository contains a comprehensive data analysis project using the **`covid_19_data.csv`** dataset.  
The goal of this project is to apply **data cleaning**, **exploratory data analysis (EDA)**, and **basic machine learning** concepts to understand and visualize global COVID-19 trends.

##  Key Features

- ** Data Cleaning: **  
  - Handled missing values  
  - Ensured correct data types  
  - Standardized column names for consistency  

- ** Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):**  
  - Aggregations to summarize the dataset  
  - Top countries by confirmed cases  
  - Mortality and recovery rates calculation  

- ** Unsupervised Learning (K-Means Clustering):**  
  - Grouped countries with similar case profiles  
  - Identified hidden patterns in the data  

- ** Data Visualization:**  
  - Plots generated using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**  
  - Scatter plot for visualizing clusters  
  - Informative charts for better understanding
